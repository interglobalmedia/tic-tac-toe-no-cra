# Tic Tac Toe Application

## Created Without Create React App

I created this application so that I could update my React Workflow incorporating the latest changes in webpack and React. However, two plugins I was using in my previous workflow have vulnerabilities which I cannot resolve at this time. They are:

image-webpack-loader
imagein-webpack-plugin

I am looking further into it, including the webpack docs. No answers in the plugin repos themselves. perhaps webpack ahs some alternatives.

This particular app does not require the importing/use of images, so I have removed anything having to do with use of images. As a result, there are now no vulnerabilities. I ran an npm audit and was also notified as such when I removed said npm packages.

When I create an app that does require the use of images, I will come up with alternative solutions to make things work!
